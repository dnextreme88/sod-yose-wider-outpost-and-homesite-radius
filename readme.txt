WIDER OUTPOST AND HOMESITE RADIUS
=================================

This mod simply increases the outpost radius and homesite radius by a small amount. Nothing much. You are free to mod this as you wish. Using Notepad or Notepad++ (I prefer the latter), press Ctrl + F on your keyboard and search for "<!-- DEFAULT: " (without the quotes). This will direct you to where the modified lines are located, should you wish to modify them yourself (or modify it independently if you have mods that modify the same files).

To install, first choose the directory where you want the mod to be applied to:
- class3/ (story mode)
- class3.1/ (breakdown)
- class3.2/ (lifeline)

Place the contents into your Steam directory of your State of Decay YOSE game. For example, "C:\Steam\steamapps\common\State of Decay YOSE\Game".

To uninstall, simply remove homeenclaves.win.bmd, homeenclaves.xml, rtsevents.win.bmd, and rtsevents.xml under the directory of the mode. For example, if you want to remove the mod on Breakdown, the directory would be libs/class3.1/rts/.

Changelogs:
V1.0 (April 22, 2021)
- Mod for Story mode

V1.1 (May 2, 2021)
